<p class="about-body">My research examines how people interact with intelligent and embodied systems across digital, physical, and immersive settings. I design and conduct human subjects studies to quantify behavior, perception, comfort, effort, and trust using a combination of experimental design, sensing technologies, and data-driven analysis.</p>

<p class="about-body">With a background in Mechatronics and Industrial Engineering, I work at the intersection of human behavior, engineered systems, and measurement science. My work integrates instrumentation, computer vision, and immersive simulations to better understand human performance and to inform the design of technologies that align with real human use in training, engineering education, and operational environments.</p>
