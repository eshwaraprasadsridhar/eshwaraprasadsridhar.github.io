## About

I am a PhD student in Industrial Engineering focusing on Human Factors and Human-Computer Interaction, where I study human-AI teaming across sociotechnical systems. My research examines how people interact with conversational agents, immersive simulations, and physical AI, with a focus on developing metrics that capture human cognition, trust, and adaptability. By combining human factors principles with computational approaches, I aim to design frameworks that reveal how humans and AI shape each other in dynamic environments. This work seeks to inform the creation of AI systems that are not only technically capable but also ethically grounded and responsive to human needs.
